<p>Volunteers contributing to <a href='https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/bogden/scarlets-and-blues'>Scarlets and Blues</a> transcribed data on the stories, lives and interactions of WWI-era staff and soldiers at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

<p>This page provides access to the document images for <i>Scarlets and Blues</i>, to the data transcribed by project volunteers, and to a record of the project itself. We are hugely grateful to everyone who contributed.</p>
