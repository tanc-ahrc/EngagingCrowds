		"content": "<p>Engaging Crowds: citizen research and heritage data at scale harnesses the capabilities of people-powered research to enrich understanding of cultural heritage collections through digitally enabled participation. Citizen research enables volunteers, including people previously not reached by cultural heritage organizations, to participate in research projects, helping classify, annotate or transcribe collections.</p><p>Engaging Crowds explores the current and potential practice of engaging diverse audiences with the creation, use and reuse of heritage data. It investigates best practice in the citizen research landscape, by considering how institutions assess, present and value the work of volunteers and by working with three groups that are potential recipients of the data volunteers produce: collections-holding organisations, machine learning algorithms, and the citizens themselves. Engaging Crowds is developing a new indexing tool that gives volunteers the agency to choose their own pathway through a project and will evaluate it by running three citizen research projects. A report based on these findings together will recommend the best ways of encouraging and supporting meaningful public interaction with heritage collections.</p><p>The project is led by The National Archives, with the Zooniverse team at the University of Oxford, Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, and Royal Museums Greenwich. All partners have significant experience of conducting citizen research projects, not least using Zooniverse, a free, open source platform with more than 1.9 million volunteers worldwide. Engaging Crowds aims to promote open discovery and research, interdisciplinary working across sectors and equality, diversity and inclusion.</p><p>This project is a Foundation project within the the <a href=\"https://ahrc.ukri.org/\">AHRC</a> funded <a href=\"https://ahrc.ukri.org/research/fundedthemesandprogrammes/tanc-opening-uk-heritage-to-the-world/\">Towards a National Collection Programme</a>.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Dreadnought Seamen’s Hospital at Greenwich was the main clinical site of the Seamen’s Hospital Society (now Seafarer’s Hospital Society), founded with the philanthropic mission of providing relief to sick and injured seafarers of all nations. Throughout the period 1821-1870 it was a floating hospital, based in three successive converted warships. It then moved on land and until 1986 occupied the buildings which are now a student hub for the University of Greenwich.</p><p> The details of admissions include name, age and place of birth, rank, employer and last vessel served on. Medical information includes dates of admission and discharge, medical condition and fate. The patients were seafarers from all over the globe, reflecting the international traffic of the port of London. Casualties from local emergencies, among them women and children, were also admitted, so were naval personnel during wartime. As well as helping to trace individuals, the records have possibilities for diverse avenues of academic research, including the history of medicine and diseases, and the history of black and Asian communities within the maritime world. Viewed quantitatively, the records show the variety and prevalence of disease, injuries and common ailments in the merchant navy for over a hundred years.</p><p>The National Maritime Museum's <i>HMS NHS: the Nautical Health Service</i> project is the first of three projects together making up the Engaging Crowds Citizen Research Project. Together the projects will each examine issues and solutions of crowd sourcing and wider citizen research and together aim to develop generic transcription software that volunteers around the world will be able to use to transcribe images of collection content, be they excerpts from diaries and journals of voyages to nineteenth century Australian gold fields, the letters of Horatio Nelson or the records of Black and Asian sailors working on British ships during the First World War. <i>HMS NHS</i> uses the records of the Dreadnought Seaman's hospital as its project. When transcribed, the project will allow digital access to the records from around the world. For the first time researchers will be able to analyse trends and patterns evident in the records as a whole. They will be able to study the health of the seafaring community,  document the effects of changes in the history of medicine, and study the frequency, extent and treatment of diseases over time, including venereal diseases, dysentery, dropsy, tropical and infectious diseases, together with all kinds of wounds and injuries sustained on board merchant vessels.</p>"

The project takes a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of people at the <a href='https://www.chelsea-pensioners.co.uk/'>Royal Hospital Chelsea</a> during the First World War. (The project title references the <a href='https://www.chelsea-pensioners.co.uk/blues'>coats worn by the Chelsea Pensioners</a>). Volunteers will use a new indexing tool created by our partner Zooniverse to work their way through records from the Royal Hospital Chelsea’s meeting minutes, which provide a fascinating glimpse into the lives of women workers and hospital staff, and the care given to injured veterans.</p><p>The classifications done by volunteers will provide new information for The National Archives catalogue, while the classifications and transcriptions together will permit investigation of research questions around how the hospital was organised, medical, women's and social history in wartime. Volunteers will classify according to predetermined categories but will also be free to describe their own categories as they discover interesting information on the talk page. The new tool will give agency to volunteers to choose their own area of work, rather than the usual process, where volunteers work on pieces selected at random. A report based on the project findings will recommend the best ways of encouraging and supporting meaningful public interaction with heritage collections.</p><p>If you’re interested in joining the project as a volunteer please email <a href='mailto:research@nationalarchives.gov.uk'>research@nationalarchives.gov.uk</a>.</p>"
