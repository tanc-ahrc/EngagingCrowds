		"content": "<p><i>Engaging Crowds: Citizen research and heritage data at scale</i> harnesses the capabilities of people-powered research to enrich understanding of cultural heritage collections through digitally enabled participation. Citizen research enables volunteers, including people previously not reached by cultural heritage organizations, to participate in research projects, helping classify, annotate or transcribe collections.</p><p><i>Engaging Crowds</i> explores the current and potential practice of engaging diverse audiences with the creation, use and reuse of heritage data. It investigates best practice in the citizen research landscape, by considering how institutions assess, present and value the work of volunteers and by working with three groups that are potential recipients of the data volunteers produce: collections-holding organisations, machine learning algorithms, and the citizens themselves. <i>Engaging Crowds</i> is developing a new indexing tool that gives volunteers the agency to choose their own pathway through a project and will evaluate it by running three citizen research projects. A report based on these findings together will recommend the best ways of encouraging and supporting meaningful public interaction with heritage collections.</p><p>The project is led by The National Archives, with the Zooniverse team at the University of Oxford, Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, and Royal Museums Greenwich. All partners have significant experience of conducting citizen research projects, not least using Zooniverse, a free, open source platform with more than 1.9 million volunteers worldwide. <i>Engaging Crowds</i> aims to promote open discovery and research, interdisciplinary working across sectors and equality, diversity and inclusion.</p><p>This project is a Foundation project within the the <a href=\"https://ahrc.ukri.org/\">AHRC</a> funded <a href=\"https://ahrc.ukri.org/research/fundedthemesandprogrammes/tanc-opening-uk-heritage-to-the-world/\">Towards a National Collection Programme</a>.</p>",

Throughout the period 1821-1870 it was a floating hospital, based in three successive converted warships. It then moved on land and until 1986 occupied the buildings which are now a student hub for the University of Greenwich.</p><p> The details of admissions include name, age and place of birth, rank, employer and last vessel served on. Medical information includes dates of admission and discharge, medical condition and fate. The patients were seafarers from all over the globe, reflecting the international traffic of the port of London. Casualties from local emergencies, among them women and children, were also admitted, so were naval personnel during wartime. As well as helping to trace individuals, the records have possibilities for diverse avenues of academic research, including the history of medicine and diseases, and the history of black and Asian communities within the maritime world. Viewed quantitatively, the records show the variety and prevalence of disease, injuries and common ailments in the merchant navy for over a hundred years.</p><p>The National Maritime Museum's <i>HMS NHS: the Nautical Health Service</i> project is the first of three projects together making up the <i>Engaging Crowds</i> citizen research project. Together the projects will each examine issues and solutions of crowd sourcing and wider citizen research and together aim to develop generic transcription software that volunteers around the world will be able to use to transcribe images of collection content, be they excerpts from diaries and journals of voyages to nineteenth century Australian gold fields, the letters of Horatio Nelson or the records of Black and Asian sailors working on British ships during the First World War. <i>HMS NHS</i> uses the records of the Dreadnought Seaman's hospital as its project. When transcribed, the project will allow digital access to the records from around the world. For the first time researchers will be able to analyse trends and patterns evident in the records as a whole. They will be able to study the health of the seafaring community,  document the effects of changes in the history of medicine, and study the frequency, extent and treatment of diseases over time, including venereal diseases, dysentery, dropsy, tropical and infectious diseases, together with all kinds of wounds and injuries sustained on board merchant vessels.</p><figure class='figure'><img src='graphics/PU6061.jpg' class='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Side view of the Dreadnought Seamen&#39s Hospital, a ship lying off Greenwich.

The specimens, alongside the collection label can be used to answer many research questions including: changes in species distribution and flowering times linked to habitat loss and climate change. Thus specimen data helps inform and target conservation and climate change mitigation efforts protecting plant species for future generations.</p><p>Our digitisation programme seeks to make this data as widely accessible as possible. Full label transcription would take around 40 years for our team of three digitisers. With the rate of species loss being estimated to be at 1000 - 10,000 above the naturally expected rate we cannot afford to take decades, we had to look for another way to speed up the process. This involved minimal data entry which is 14 times faster in combination with citizen science label transcription.</p><p>The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh will be launching a citizen science project on Zooniverse which aims to transcribe the data on the collection labels of plant specimens collected from across the world over a period of more than 200 years. The specimens, alongside the collection label can be used to answer many research questions including changes in species distribution and flowering times linked to habitat loss and climate change. Thus specimen data helps inform and target conservation and climate change mitigation efforts protecting plant species for future generations. The specimens in this project are all in the Gesneriaceae plant family which will be familiar to many from the widely cultivated houseplants, African Violets. All these cultivated African Violets are derived from a handful of species found only in Tanzania and Kenya and which are under threat of extinction. As a whole, the family has about 2,500 species from mostly tropical environments, and a large number of species are only known from one or two specimens. This is part of <i>Engaging Crowds: Citizen research and heritage data at scale</i>, a project funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council. Within the AHRC programme we want to analyse the impact of increasing agency of the citizen scientist on data quality.</p><p>We will create two projects: a baseline project and indexed project, splitting up our digital specimen images of the plant family Gesneriaceae into two randomised datasets. These will build upon previous analysis of data quality from citizen science projects carried out at RBGE. We will use dropdown lists where possible as this has proved to increase transcription accuracy. We will also include the ability for volunteers to indicate where data are either missing or illegible on the specimen labels. The baseline project will present specimens to the volunteers in a random order. The indexed project will utilise output from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, created from our specimen images, to pull out batches associated with specific collectors and geographical locations. When used in conjunction with the Zooniverse indexing tool this will allow volunteers to choose a subset of transcription tasks. It will be interesting to see how this impacts the both transcriber behaviour and data quality. Experience from previous projects indicates that different transcribers have strengths in transcribing different aspects of specimen data.</p><figure class='figure'><img src='graphics/rgbe_table.jpg' class='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Close up view of a table laden with objects, taken from table height.

Whether you've worked on a project coming from a museum, archive, gallery or other cultural institution, we'd love to hear from you. Please do join us at our upcoming online event on 1 December 2021.</p><p><i>Engaging Crowds: Citizen research and heritage data at scale</i> harnesses the capabilities of people-powered research to enrich understanding of cultural heritage collections through digitally enabled participation. As part of this project, Royal Museums Greenwich is hosting an online workshop to hear volunteers' opinions on what works and what doesn't when it comes to online cultural heritage projects.</p><p>If you've transcribed documents, tagged images or volunteered on an online cultural heritage project in other ways, we'd be very grateful if you'd be willing to share your experience with us.</p><p>We want to know: what motivates and engages you? What kinds of tasks do you enjoy? What features do you like and how could the platforms you use be improved? What is it about online cultural heritage projects that encourages you to give your time and how can we make that volunteer experience better?</p><p>The workshop will start with short presentations from speakers, providing an overview of the Engaging Crowds project and a demonstration of a brand new indexing tool on the Zooniverse citizen research platform, which allows volunteers to choose their own pathway through a citizen research project. An important part of the workshop will be informal discussions in break out groups where we will ask you to chat about your experiences and preferences relating to online volunteering.</p><p>Join us for an online only event.<br/><b>Date:</b> Wednesday 1 December 2021<br/><b>When:</b> 14.00-16.00 GMT<br/><b>Where:</b> Online, via Zoom registration</p><p>Places are limited and will be on a first come first served basis.
