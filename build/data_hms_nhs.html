<p><a href='https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/msalmon/hms-nhs-the-nautical-health-service'>HMS NHS</a> invites volunteers to transcribe 100 years of seafarer’s medical data from the Dreadnought Seamen’s Hospital at Greenwich. The project is led by <a href='https://www.rmg.co.uk/'>Royal Museums Greenwich</a>.</p>
<p>This page provides access to the document images for <i>HMS NHS</i> and to the data transcribed by project volunteers. We are hugely grateful to everyone who contributed.</p>
<p><b>Project data</b></p>
  <!-- Just providing the Phase 1 Quality and Phase 2 Admission Number workflows here. This is because:
       * The index is identical for all HMS NHS workflows
       * The Phase 1 Quality workflow was retired ahead of Phase 2 and thus this preserves the project as indexed in Phase 1
       * The Phase 2 Admission Number workflow shows all of Phase 2 and none of Phase 1 (despite not being specific to Phase 2)
       * The only slight drawback is that this then does not double up as a way of looking at the workflow tasks themselves.
         * But the requirement that we are satisfying here is to be able to view the images, so that is OK.

  <p>The 'part 2' data consists of all classifications for volumes 19-34, inclusive.</p>
  <p>Data from 'test' workflow versions are excluded.</p>
  <p>The 'part 2' data does not overlap with the 'part 1' data <b>except</b> that the classifications with ids 392796932 and 392798956 also appear in 'part 1'.</p>
  <p>Pseudonyms based upon hash of IP address (that is, pseudonyms with prefix 'anon:') are thought not to be comparable with pseudonyms from other data drops of this project.</p>

<p>Download screenshots of guidance given to volunteers as <a href='data/HMS_NHS_guidance.zip'>zip</a> or <a href='data/HMS_NHS_guidance.tar.xz'>tar.xz</a>. This guidance describes the phase 2 workflows, but guidance for phase 1 will have been similar. One notable difference is that phase 1 workflows do not have extra entry boxes for unusually long columns.</p>

    <p>HMS NHS has a large number of workflows. We have recorded three tutorial videos to be representative of the kinds of workflows included in the project.</p>
    <p>Details of all of the workflows in phase 2 can be seen in the screenshots of guidance, linked above.</p>
