<p><a href='https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/msalmon/hms-nhs-the-nautical-health-service'>HMS NHS</a> invites volunteers to transcribe 100 years of seafarer’s medical data from the Dreadnought Seamen’s Hospital at Greenwich. The project is led by <a href='https://www.rmg.co.uk/'>Royal Museums Greenwich</a>.</p>
<p>This page provides access to the document images and the data transcribed by the <i>HMS NHS</i> volunteers. We are hugely grateful to everyone who contributed.</p>

  <!-- Just providing the Phase 1 Quality workflow here. This is because:
       * The index is identical for all HMS NHS workflows
       * The Phase 1 Quality workflow was retired ahead of Phase 2 and thus this preserves the project as indexed in Phase 1
       * The only slight drawback is that this then does not double up as a way of looking at the workflow tasks themselves.
         * But the requirement that we are satisfying here is to be able to view the images, so that is OK.
