<p><b>Information on reproduction</b></p>
<p>The charts were generated by scripts at https://github.com/nationalarchives/engagingcrowds_engagement.git.</p>
<p>A reproduction recipe is included in the README.txt in the downloads, above.</p>
<p>Modifying that recipe to use commit 97cedb41511b9494b750152b26d91cfe24bd46d1 will produce the charts shown in the report.</p>
<p>The charts should not change significantly with later commits, but new charts may be added or bugs may be fixed.</p>
