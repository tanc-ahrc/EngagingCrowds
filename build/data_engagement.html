<p>Engagement Analysis</p>
<p>Classification data from all three projects was analyzed as a part of Engaging Crowds and is described in appendix TODO of the<a href='TODO'>final report.</a>
<ul>
  <li>View images of documents used in the project via Zooniverse (LINK -- at minimum can just be an index.html pointing to each file, or even just the directory tree -- headings of file type, followed by lists of the files, seems like a reasonable way to go)</li>
  <li>View the charts used in the data analysis </li>
  <li>Download the data that the data analysis was based upon (as a <a href='data/Scarlets_and_Blues.zip'>zip</a> or as a <a href='data/Scarlets_and_Blues.tar.xz'>tarball</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Information on reproduction</b></p>
<p>The charts were generated by scripts at https://github.com/nationalarchives/engagingcrowds_engagement.git.</p>
<p>A reproduction recipe is included in the README.txt in the downloads, above.</p>
<p>Modifying that recipe to use commit 97cedb41511b9494b750152b26d91cfe24bd46d1 will produce the charts shown in the report.</p>
<p>The charts should not change significantly with later commits, but new charts may be added or bugs may be fixed.</p>
